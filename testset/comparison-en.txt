Correct 9 out of 45 non-empty CONV values => recall    20%.
Correct 9 out of 51 non-empty GOLD values => precision 18%.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:
Number of nodes per file: GOLD:1279, CONV:1195
File-to-file node mapping:
Out of 1279 total GOLD nodes, 875 mapped to CONV => recall    = 68%.
Out of 1195 total CONV nodes, 875 mapped to GOLD => precision = 73%.
 => F₁(GOLD,CONV) = 71%.
Before symmetrization, 54 GOLD nodes were projected ambiguously to 111 CONV nodes.
Before symmetrization, 202 CONV nodes were projected ambiguously to 420 GOLD nodes.
Concept and relation comparisons (only mapped nodes; unmapped are ignored):
Out of 2647 non-empty GOLD values, 969 found in CONV => recall    37%.
Out of 2578 non-empty CONV values, 969 found in GOLD => precision 38%.
 => F₁ = 37%.
Concept and relation comparisons (for unmapped nodes all counted as incorrect):
Out of 3702 non-empty GOLD values, 969 found in CONV => recall    26%.
Out of 3401 non-empty CONV values, 969 found in GOLD => precision 28%.
 => juːmæʧ (GOLD, CONV) = F₁ = 27%.
